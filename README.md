This repository contains the solution of HW3.

The first question is about a simple implementation of a restaurant...  
Think of a restaurant which takes orders only for lunch or dinner and it has seperate menu for each meal. In this restaurant, taxes will be calculated by 10% for lunch and 15% for dinner. In initial menu, the user can choose his/her role as a manager or a customer, besides that by choosing option 3, exit, the application will be stopped.


>      *** Welcome to restaurant system ***
>      1) Login as a manager
>      2) Login as a customer
>      3) Exit


1- Manager

By choosing the first option the below menu will be shown:
>      *** Manager Menu ***
>      1) Add to dinner menu
>      2) Add to lunch menu
>      3) Customer info
>      4) Back to main menu

2- Customer
>      *** Manager Menu ***
>      1) Add new order
>      2) Show orders details
>      3) Cancel an order
>      4) Back to main menu
The second one is about the inheritance... 

The third question asks the difference between composition and aggregation relations in java.
